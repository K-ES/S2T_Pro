## Known Issues and Current Tasks

### Issues:
1. **The need for highlighting all final values of the last query:**
   There is a requirement to visually highlight all the final values in the last SQL query to make them easier to identify.

2. **The need for highlighting all CTEs involved in the final value:**
   It is necessary to highlight all CTEs that participate in producing the final value, to better track the relationships and flow of the query.

### Planned Improvements:
- Implement highlighting for all final values in the last query.
- Add support for highlighting all CTEs that contribute to the final value in the query.

These improvements will help in better visualizing and understanding complex queries, especially those with multiple CTEs.
